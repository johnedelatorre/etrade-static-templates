      <h1>E*Trade Bootstrap</h1><p>This version of Bootstrap has been customized and formatted to fit the E*TRADE brand and style guidelines. In fact, it&#39;s become the source of the style guidlines, as we build sites in code and not in Jpegs.</p>
<p>Documentation is in the <code>docs</code> folder, and all of that is generated into a styleguide visible at [<a href="http://styleguide.etradecreative.com">http://styleguide.etradecreative.com</a>] user: client password: Race2015!</p>
<h2>Installation</h2><p>Ideally this package should be a bower component, which pulls in its dependencies for development. However, you should be able to use this just by pointing at the <code>css/etrade-bootstrap.css</code> file, with the <code>fonts</code> folder and its contents as a sibling to the <code>css</code> folder. (This will allow the icon font to work). The CSS is compiled for every tagged release, so you don&#39;t have to recompile the source <code>.scss</code> files.</p>
<h2>Developing with other projects</h2><p>You can use the <code>bower link</code> command to create a symlink to this repo when working in other projects so that you can see how the changes you make to this project affect other projects that have it as a bower dependency.</p>
<p>To accomplish this</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone this repo to your local machine</li>
<li>From inside the project directory run <code>$ bower link</code></li>
<li>Run <code>gulp watch</code> inside this project to start watching for changes</li>
<li>From any project that has this project as a dependency, run <code>$ bower link etrade-bootstrap</code></li>
<li>Any changes you make in this project will be reflected in the target project until the next time you run <code>bower update</code></li>
</ol>
